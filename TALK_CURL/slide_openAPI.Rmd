####   How to *WRITE* an API:    openAPI

####  Attempt to simplify and standardize how the developer determines the API structure.

https://oai.github.io/Documentation/start-here.html

```

The OAS defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OAS, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OAS removes guesswork in calling a service.
```


###  R Plumber package sets up local server to create APIs.
